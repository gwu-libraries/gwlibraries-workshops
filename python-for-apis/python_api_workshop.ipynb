        "In this workshop, we covered the basics of using Python to retrieve data from API's. This approach may cover many of your uses cases. But here are a few tips for further exploration:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   If you need to make many requests in tandem -- _e.g._, you want to request stock price data for a long list of commodities -- you can sometimes speed up your code dramatically by using the asynchronous functionality available in the most recent releases of Python. \n",
        "    * The [`aiohttp` library](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides functions that, in conjunction with the `asyncio` library that ships with Python 3.7+, allow you to make asynchronous HTTP requests. For an introduction to asynchronous programming in Python that covers the latest developments, see \"[Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/).\"\n",
        "*   Though many API's return data in JSON, some use XML instead. Unlike JSON, XML can't be converted to Python data types in one step; it's necessary to parse the XML first and extract the elements you want. The [lxml](https://lxml.de/) library provides robust functionality for doing that.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Before using any API, make sure you read the documentation and the terms of service. \n",
        "    * Many API's require you to limit your requests to a certain number per specified time period (_e.g._, per second, per hour, per day.) Violating these limits can sometimes cause the provider to shut off access to your account/IP address.\n",
        "    * Some API's place restrictions on what you can do with the data. For instance, they may make it available only for research purposes, or only non-commercial uses, etc. \n",
