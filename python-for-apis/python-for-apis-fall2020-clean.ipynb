    "#### What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is a generic term for functionality that allows one computer application to talk to another. In contrast to a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows an end user to interact with an application via visual symbols (*e.g.* icons) and manual operations (*e.g.* mouse clicks), an API allows a user to interact with the application by writing code. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### What is REST?\n",
    "\n",
    "**R**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer refers to a common set of principles implemented by services that communicate via the web. Most RESTful API's use **HTTP** to provide access. Via HTTP and its core methods, you code can communicate with a web service the way your browser does when you visit a web site. We'll see how to write code to do just that in this workshop.   "

    "In this workshop we've seen how to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query an API with `requests` and parse a JSON response\n",
    "- Use URL parameters in constructing our request\n",
    "- Use `try` and `catch` to trap errors that might arise\n",
    "- Use `pandas` to create a `DataFrame` from JSON data\n",
    "- Use functions to encapsulate and reuse code\n",
    "- Group, aggregate, and plot data with a `DataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "For another set of examples that explore other API topics, see the material for last year's [Python for API's workshop](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops/blob/master/python-for-apis/python_api_workshop.ipynb), which covers retrieving data from API's with paginated results and using API keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related topic but one beyond the scope of our workshop is **web scraping**, which is useful when you need to extract data from a website that does not provide a REST API. There are a number of resources available on web scraping in Python, including the O'Reilly book [Web Scraping with Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/web-scraping-with/9781491985564/), available to GW students, faculty, and staff via our [Safari Tech Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/temporary-access) subscription."
