    "The early history of computing revolves around efforts to automate human computation -- human labor. And from Lovelace to Turing and beyond, a key concern lay in the specification and refinement of _algorithms_: methods of reducing complex calculations and other operations to explicit formal rules, rules that could, in principle, be implemented with rigor and precision by purely mechanical (and later, of course, electronic) means. \n",
    "\n",
    "But as a means of understanding Chat GPT and other forms of [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence), a consideration of algorithms only gets us so far. In fact, when it comes to the [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) that have captivated the public imagination, I would argue that their \"unreasonable effectiveness\" is less a triumph of the algorithm, than the manifestation of another strand of computation, bound up with the former, but motivated by distinct pressures and concerns. Instead of formal logic and mathematical proof, this strand draws on traditions of thinking about data, randomness, and probability. And instead of the prescription of actions, it aims at the description and prediction of aspects of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most interesting moments in this tradition, in light of later developments, remains Claude Shannon's work on modeling the structure of printed English. In this interactive document, we will use the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org) to reproduce a couple of Shannon's experiments, in the hopes of pulling back the curtain a bit on what seems to many (and not unreasonably) as evidence of a ghost in the machine. But the aim is not necessarily to demystify experiences of generative AI. I, for one, do find many of these experiences haunting. But maybe the haunting doesn't happen where we at first assume.\n",

By virtue of using computers and smartphones, we are all familiar with the concept of an interface, which instantiates a set of rules prescribing how we are to interact with the device in order to accomplish well-defined tasks. These interactions get encoded down to the level of electronic pulses (and the results of the computation are translated back into the encoding of the interface). \n",
