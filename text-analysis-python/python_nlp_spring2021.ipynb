    "#### Defining NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this workshop, natural-language processing (NLP for short) refers to the use of computational methods to analyze samples of written or spoken language produced by human beings. The term _natural_ refers to the fact that the languages in question are those that have emerged from the crucible of human speech and social interaction. An example of a language **not** considered natural would be a programming language, such as Python. Computers, of course, regularly process these kinds of languages; in a sense, that is what they are designed to do. \n",

    "#### Why NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make computers better at talking to us / thinking like us (semantic search, artificial intelligence)\n",
    "- To improve digital interfaces (voice recognition)\n",
    "- To automate human communicative tasks (chatbots, autocomplete, text generation)\n",
    "- To understand human discourse computationally (textual analysis)\n",
    "- To enhance surveillance, monitoring, and control (content filtering, predictive analysis)"

    "[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is a Python library for NLP. Other libraries exists, most notably [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) that provide similar functionality. But spaCy combines a user-friendly interface with high performance (the _Cy_ in _spaCy_ alludes to the fact that under the hood, a lot of the library is written in Cython, which is a hybrid of Python and the programming language C). \n",

    "A more ambitious form of semantic analysis seeks quantitatively to represent the _meanings_ of words based on their relative similarity to other words. As you might imagine, this task is fraught with difficulty, since meaning in natural languages is so highly contextual. The words we speak or write represent just the tip of the iceberg of what we mean -- a fact attested to by how frequently a community of human speakers can disagree about the meaning of the utterances their members produce. Certain words stand out as flashpoints of controversy: think about the range of meanings people attribute to a word like _racism_ or _safety_ or _science_. But in general, this indeterminancy affects all human language. Beneath the written text or spoken utterance lies a huge weight of personal experience and collective history.\n",

These algorithms tend either to apply sophisticated statistical techniques or -- more recently -- to make use of neural networks.
