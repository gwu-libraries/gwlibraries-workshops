The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the multi-sector landscape and to provide you with an interdisciplinary framework you can use to effectively mobilize individuals and organizations across sectors. Using case studies and simulations the course will explore the core challenges and opportunities facing multi-sector leaders in business, government, and in the non-profit sector. The course will stress the need for you to look outside of your immediate organizational environment and to take a broader view on the identities, incentives, and social roles that influence attitudes and behavior across sectors.
