    "We have just scratched the surface of what's possible with pandas and DataFrames. The library is widely used in academic disciplines as well as in professional fields like finance. It has many applications in machine learning and data science, especially as a tool for cleaning and re-shaping data prior to analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is a key source for learning more. \n",
