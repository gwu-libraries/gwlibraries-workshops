# Introduction to Python Workshop

This is the repository for the Introduction to Python workshop at GW Libraries.

The workshop materials are in the form of iPython notebooks.  Provided here are two alternatives for running the notebooks:

* [Google Colaboratory](instructions/google_colab_instructions.pdf)

   For importing into Google Colab from Github:  Search on: `gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops`
   
   In case "Google Colaboratory" fails to appear in the "New" menu in Google Drive, go to this link: https://colab.research.google.com/ (you may want to bookmark this)
   
   And a handy link for ways to import/export files in Google Colaboratory:  https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb
   
   Or:
   - Workbook 1: [![Open Workbook 1 In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops/blob/master/python-programming/Python_Workshop_Part_1.ipynb)
   - Workbook 2: [![Open Workbook 2 In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops/blob/master/python-programming/Python_Workshop_Part_2.ipynb)
